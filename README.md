## Commands

| command   | purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `cat`     | gather file contents (e.g. for piping to [`llm`](https://github.com/simonw/llm)). often used with `--copy` + `--prompt` |
| `map`     | survey file/folder structure(s) with [aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)                                                     |
| `shell`   | capture output from arbitrary shell commands                                                     |
| `fetch`   | retrieve Linear issues (legacy)                                                            |
| `payload` | compose text and file blocks from a YAML manifest                                          |

All commands work with the global flags `--prompt`, `--wrap`, `--copy`, and `--write-file`.


**Sample invocations (`cat`):**

```bash
# gather files and copy (individually wrapped + labelled, prefixed by '--prompt') to clipboard
contextualize cat contextualize/ README.md --copy --prompt "how does this work?"

# fetch a single file from a remote repo (cached under ~/.local/share/contextualize/cache/git/)
contextualize cat gh:jmpaz/contextualize:README.md

# gather multiple files/folder(s) from a repo
contextualize cat https://git.sr.ht/~cismonx/bookmarkfs:README.md,doc
